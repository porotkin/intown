# InTown
It is a project I coded with my friend.
This application allows you to share your location with your friends via VK (popular social media service in Russia).
This frontend is made with React and VK library. It also utilizes Yandex.Maps and connects to vk native mobile app and uses its API.
I have coded the backend using Golang. The project has PostgreSQL database.
It was an idea of mine that I wanted to implement.
